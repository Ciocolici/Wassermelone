# Wassermelone
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. A receipt simulation for a purchase of watermelon(s).

The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch Wassermelone.exe located in bin/Debug/net6.0/.*

*Note: german language used.*
